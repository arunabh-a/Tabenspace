## Vision
- An Organized Space creates a piece of mind same with the digital world
- Whether it be their regular visited applications or their point of interest in the web, people often have their data cluttered and it results in inefficient productivity experience defined by countless tabs and constant multi-tasking.
- So around the mid-2000s, lots of PIMs (Personal Information Managers) were introduced. One such application was Idenati. Released on August 13 2020. Idenati started with the vision of being 'one piece of software to organize everything you do on the internet'. It became a major productivity app gaining popularity over the internet and thousands of people made it part of their lives.
- But in the past few months, the company started facing some financial problems and on December 23rd 2022 Idenati was shut down.

## Idea
- Our idea is to remake the application making it free for all to simplify and organize your websites, allowing you to be more productive, fast and organized. 
- With Tabenspace, you will be able to manage and organize your regularly used web apps and websites with just a few clicks.
